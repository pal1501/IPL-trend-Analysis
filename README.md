# IPL Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboards (Power BI + Python)

This project aims to analyze Indian Premier League (IPL) datasets to extract meaningful insights and present them using interactive dashboards. By leveraging tools like **Power BI**, **Python**, and libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, we uncover trends in team performances, player statistics, venues, and match outcomes.
